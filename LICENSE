## Additional Terms for UK Digital Identity Platform

### Government Use License Addendum

This software is developed as an open-source implementation of digital identity 
concepts for educational, research, and development purposes. While the code is 
freely available under the MIT license, any actual deployment for official 
government identity services would require:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Full compliance with UK data protection laws, 
   GDPR, and relevant government security standards.

2. **Security Certification**: Appropriate security clearances and certifications 
   for production deployment in government environments.

3. **Data Protection**: Implementation of additional safeguards for handling 
   personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive government data.

4. **Audit Requirements**: Regular security audits and penetration testing 
   as required by government standards.

### Disclaimer

This implementation is provided for demonstration and development purposes. 
It should not be used for actual identity verification or credential issuance 
without proper security review, testing, and compliance validation.

The authors make no claims about the production readiness or security of this 
implementation for handling real personal identity data or government services.
